# between_two_sets
Based on an algorithm task on [https://www.hackerrank.com](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/between-two-sets) called *Between Two Sets* I created a script which uses only the two sets without the other inputs. The following conditions have to be true if we talk about a number between two sets A and B:
1. all elements in a set A have to be a factor of x
2. this x is a factor of all elements in B
